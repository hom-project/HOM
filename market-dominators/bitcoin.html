		<h1>About Bitcoin</h1>
		<div class="about-content">
			<h3>What is Bitcoin ?</h3>

			<p>(₿) is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent
				from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are
				verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.
				The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi
				Nakamoto. The currency began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source
				software.</p>

			<p>Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies,
				products, and services. Bitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions, the large amount of
				electricity (and thus carbon footprint) used by mining, price volatility, and thefts from exchanges. Some
				investors and economists have characterized it as a speculative bubble at various times. Others have used it as
				an
				investment, although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin. In
				September 2021, El Salvador officially adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, in the face of internal and
				international
				criticism, becoming the first nation to do so.</p>

			<p>The word bitcoin was defined in a white paper published on 31 October 2008. It is a compound of the words
				bit and coin. No uniform convention for bitcoin capitalization exists; some sources use Bitcoin, capitalized,
				to refer to the technology and network and bitcoin, lowercase, for the unit of account. The Wall Street
				Journal, The Chronicle of Higher Education, and the Oxford English Dictionary advocate the use of
				lowercase bitcoin in all cases.</p>

			<hr>

			<h3>Price and Volatility</h3>

			<p>The price of bitcoins has gone through cycles of appreciation and depreciation referred to by some as bubbles
				and busts. In 2011, the value of one bitcoin rapidly rose from about US$0.30 to US$32 before returning to US$2.
				In the latter half of 2012 and during the 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis, the bitcoin price began to rise,
				reaching a high of US$266 on 10 April 2013, before crashing to around US$50. On 29 November 2013, the cost of
				one bitcoin rose to a peak of US$1,242. In 2014, the price fell sharply, and as of April remained depressed at
				little more than half 2013 prices. As of August 2014 it was under US$600.</p>

			<p>According to Mark T. Williams, as of 30 September 2014, bitcoin has volatility seven times greater than gold,
				eight times greater than the S&P 500, and 18 times greater than the US dollar. Hodl is a meme created in
				reference to holding (as opposed to selling) during periods of volatility. Unusual for an asset, bitcoin weekend
				trading during December 2020 was higher than for weekdays. Hedge funds (using high leverage and derivates) have
				attempted to use the volatility to profit from downward price movements. At the end of January 2021, such
				positions were over $1 billion, their highest of all time. As of 8 February 2021, the closing price of bitcoin
				equaled US$44,797.</p>

			<hr>

			<h3>Regulatory Warnings</h3>

			<p>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has issued four "Customer Advisories" for bitcoin and related
				investments. A July 2018 warning emphasized that trading in any cryptocurrency is often speculative, and there
				is a risk of theft from hacking, and fraud. In May 2014 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned that
				investments involving bitcoin might have high rates of fraud, and that investors might be solicited on social
				media sites. An earlier "Investor Alert" warned about the use of bitcoin in Ponzi schemes.</p>

			<p>The European Banking Authority issued a warning in 2013 focusing on the lack of regulation of bitcoin, the
				chance that exchanges would be hacked, the volatility of bitcoin's price, and general fraud. FINRA and the North
				American Securities Administrators Association have both issued investor alerts about bitcoin.</p>

			<hr>

			<h3>Price Manipulation Investigation</h3>

			<p>An official investigation into bitcoin traders was reported in May 2018. The U.S. Justice Department launched
				an investigation into possible price manipulation, including the techniques of spoofing and wash trades.</p>

			<p>The U.S. federal investigation was prompted by concerns of possible manipulation during futures settlement
				dates. The final settlement price of CME bitcoin futures is determined by prices on four exchanges, Bitstamp,
				Coinbase, itBit and Kraken. Following the first delivery date in January 2018, the CME requested extensive
				detailed trading information but several of the exchanges refused to provide it and later provided only limited
				data. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission then subpoenaed the data from the exchanges.</p>

			<p>State and provincial securities regulators, coordinated through the North American Securities Administrators
				Association, are investigating "bitcoin scams" and ICOs in 40 jurisdictions.</p>

			<p>Academic research published in the Journal of Monetary Economics concluded that price manipulation occurred
				during the Mt Gox bitcoin theft and that the market remains vulnerable to manipulation. The history of hacks,
				fraud and theft involving bitcoin dates back to at least 2011.[</p>

			<p>Research by John M. Griffin and Amin Shams in 2018 suggests that trading associated with increases in the
				amount of the Tether cryptocurrency and associated trading at the Bitfinex exchange account for about half of
				the price increase in bitcoin in late 2017.</p>

			<p>J.L. van der Velde, CEO of both Bitfinex and Tether, denied the claims of price manipulation: "Bitfinex nor
				Tether is, or has ever, engaged in any sort of market or price manipulation. Tether issuances cannot be used to
				prop up the price of bitcoin or any other coin/token on Bitfinex.</p>

			<hr>

			<h3>Criticisms</h3>

			<h5>Economic concerns</h5>
			<p>Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, has been described as an economic bubble by at least eight Nobel
				Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences laureates at various times, including Robert Shiller on 1 March 2014,[198]
				Joseph Stiglitz on 29 November 2017,[257] and Richard Thaler on 21 December 2017.[258][259] On 29 January 2018,
				a noted Keynesian economist Paul Krugman has described bitcoin as "a bubble wrapped in techno-mysticism inside a
				cocoon of libertarian ideology",[189] on 2 February 2018, professor Nouriel Roubini of New York University has
				called bitcoin the "mother of all bubbles",[260] and on 27 April 2018, a University of Chicago economist James
				Heckman has compared it to the 17th-century tulip mania.</p>

			<p>Journalists, economists, investors, and the central bank of Estonia have voiced concerns that bitcoin is a
				Ponzi scheme.[261][262][263][264] In April 2013, Eric Posner, a law professor at the University of Chicago,
				stated that "a real Ponzi scheme takes fraud; bitcoin, by contrast, seems more like a collective delusion."[265]
				A July 2014 report by the World Bank concluded that bitcoin was not a deliberate Ponzi scheme.[266]: 7  In June
				2014, the Swiss Federal Council examined concerns that bitcoin might be a pyramid scheme, and concluded that
				"since in the case of bitcoin the typical promises of profits are lacking, it cannot be assumed that bitcoin is
				a pyramid scheme."</p>

			<p>Bitcoin wealth is highly concentrated, with 0.01% holding 27% of in-circulation currency, as of 2021.</p>

			<h5>Energy consumption and carbon footprint</h5>
			<p>Bitcoin has been criticized for the amount of electricity consumed by mining. On the other hand, several papers
				concluded that Bitcoin mining could promote renewable energy sources if used as an additional source of income.
			</p>

			<p>As of 2022, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) estimates that bitcoin consumes 131 TWh
				annually, representing 0.29% of the world's energy production and ranking bitcoin mining between Ukraine and
				Egypt in terms of electricity consumption.[</p>

			<p>Until 2021, according to the CCAF much of bitcoin mining was done in China. Chinese miners used to rely on
				cheap coal power in Xinjiang in late autumn, winter and spring, and then migrate to regions with overcapacities
				in low-cost hydropower, like Sichuan, between May and October. In June 2021 China banned Bitcoin mining and
				Chinese miners moved to other countries such as the US and Kazakhstan.[</p>

			<p>As of September 2021, according to the New York Times, Bitcoin's use of renewables range from 40% to
				75%.According to the Bitcoin Mining Council and based on a survey of 32% of the current global bitcoin network,
				56% of bitcoin mining came from renewable resources in Q2 2021.</p>

			<p>The development of intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind power and solar power, is challenging
				because they cause instability in the electrical grid. Several papers concluded that these renewable power
				stations could use the surplus energy to mine Bitcoin and thereby reduce curtailment, hedge electricity price
				risk, stabilize the grid, increase the profitability of renewable energy infrastructure, and therefore
				accelerate transition to sustainable energy and decrease Bitcoin's carbon footprint.</p>

			<p>Concerns about bitcoin's environmental impact relate bitcoin's energy consumption to carbon emissions. The
				difficulty of translating the energy consumption into carbon emissions lies in the decentralized nature of
				bitcoin impeding the localization of miners to examine the electricity mix used. The results of recent studies
				analyzing bitcoin's carbon footprint vary. A 2018 study published in Nature Climate Change by Mora et al.
				claimed that bitcoin "could alone produce enough CO2 emissions to push warming above 2 °C within less than three
				decades." However, three other studies also published in Nature Climate Change later dismissed this analysis on
				account of its poor methodology and false assumptions with one study concluding: "[T]he scenarios used by Mora
				et al are fundamentally flawed and should not be taken seriously by the public, researchers, or policymakers."
				According to studies published in Joule and American Chemical Society in 2019, bitcoin's annual energy
				consumption results in annual carbon emission ranging from 17 to 22.9 MtCO2 which is comparable to the level of
				emissions of countries as Jordan and Sri Lanka or Kansas City. George Kamiya, writing for the International
				Energy Agency, says that "predictions about bitcoin consuming the entire world's electricity" are sensational,
				but that the area "requires careful monitoring and rigorous analysis". One study done by Michael Novogratz's
				Galaxy Digital claimed that Bitcoin mining used less energy than the traditional banking system.</p>

			<h5>Use in Illegal Transactions</h5>
			<p>The use of bitcoin by criminals has attracted the attention of financial regulators, legislative bodies, law
				enforcement, and the media.[299]</p>

			<p>Several news outlets have asserted that the popularity of bitcoins hinges on the ability to use them to
				purchase illegal goods.[195][300] Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz says that bitcoin's anonymity
				encourages money laundering and other crimes.</p>

			<hr>

			<h3>Software Implementation</h3>
			<p>Bitcoin Core is free and open-source software that serves as a bitcoin node (the set of which form the bitcoin
				network) and provides a bitcoin wallet which fully verifies payments. It is considered to be bitcoin's reference
				implementation. Initially, the software was published by Satoshi Nakamoto under the name "Bitcoin", and later
				renamed to "Bitcoin Core" to distinguish it from the network. It is also known as the Satoshi client.</p>

			<p>The MIT Digital Currency Initiative funds some of the development of Bitcoin Core. The project also maintains
				the cryptography library libsecp256k1.</p>

			<p>Bitcoin Core includes a transaction verification engine and connects to the bitcoin network as a full node.
				Moreover, a cryptocurrency wallet, which can be used to transfer funds, is included by default. The wallet
				allows for the sending and receiving of bitcoins. It does not facilitate the buying or selling of bitcoin. It
				allows users to generate QR codes to receive payment.</p>

			<p>The software validates the entire blockchain, which includes all bitcoin transactions ever. This distributed
				ledger which has reached more than 235 gigabytes in size as of Jan 2019, must be downloaded or synchronized
				before full participation of the client may occur. Although the complete blockchain is not needed all at once
				since it is possible to run in pruning mode. A command line-based daemon with a JSON-RPC interface, bitcoind, is
				bundled with Bitcoin Core. It also provides access to testnet, a global testing environment that imitates the
				bitcoin main network using an alternative blockchain where valueless "test bitcoins" are used. Regtest or
				Regression Test Mode creates a private blockchain which is used as a local testing environment. Finally,
				bitcoin-cli, a simple program which allows users to send RPC commands to bitcoind, is also included.</p>

			<p>Checkpoints which have been hard coded into the client are used only to prevent Denial of Service attacks
				against nodes which are initially syncing the chain. For this reason the checkpoints included are only as of
				several years ago. A one megabyte block size limit was added in 2010 by Satoshi Nakamoto. This limited the
				maximum network capacity to about three transactions per second. Since then, network capacity has been improved
				incrementally both through block size increases and improved wallet behavior. A network alert system was
				included by Satoshi Nakamoto as a way of informing users of important news regarding bitcoin. In November 2016
				it was retired. It had become obsolete as news on bitcoin is now widely disseminated.</p>

			<p>Bitcoin Core includes a scripting language inspired by Forth that can define transactions and specify
				parameters. ScriptPubKey is used to "lock" transactions based on a set of future conditions. scriptSig is used
				to meet these conditions or "unlock" a transaction. Operations on the data are performed by various OP_Codes.
				Two stacks are used - main and alt. Looping is forbidden.</p>

			<p>Bitcoin Core uses OpenTimestamps to timestamp merge commits.</p>

			<p>The original creator of the bitcoin client has described their approach to the software's authorship as it
				being written first to prove to themselves that the concept of purely peer-to-peer electronic cash was valid and
				that a paper with solutions could be written. The lead developer is Wladimir J. van der Laan, who took over the
				role on 8 April 2014. Gavin Andresen was the former lead maintainer for the software client. Andresen left the
				role of lead developer for bitcoin to work on the strategic development of its technology. Bitcoin Core in 2015
				was central to a dispute with Bitcoin XT, a competing client that sought to increase the blocksize. Over a dozen
				different companies and industry groups fund the development of Bitcoin Core.</p>
